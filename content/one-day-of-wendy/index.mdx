What do you do during your day? 


## My day just starts

For me, my day is so simple. Most of the time I spend time to work. 

As I'm working from home, I always start my work early in the morning and right from my bed. 
Usually, I wake up just 15 minutes before my working time, start all my tools and start working right away. 
What time do you usually wake up? Most of the days of the week, I started my working day so early, from 7am, sometimes ealier from 6am. But since I don't need to travel to work. So I can just wake up 15 minutes before work and that's enough. 

And that's it. One day just start. 

### I skip breakfast

I don't eat breakfast. Not because I don't like it but because I'm lazy to wake up early and prepare for it. 

I know. I know. I know it's not good. But... my bed is too comfy in the morning. 

So skip the breakfast and working right away. I usually work straight for 5-6-7 or even more hours, depends on my self-schedual of that day. 
Once the work is done. I will have a nap, maybe just one or two hours. 

But I'm quite difficult to sleep, so sometimes I can't sleep and just stay on my phone. 


## My favorite coffee
And then, I go to my favorite coffee shop. 

### Ta Coffee

In the normal day, when I can take Molly with me and the weather is not so cold. I will go to Ta coffe. That is one of the most favorite coffee. 

They offer a unique coffee experience, roasting the beans with a large machine right inside the shop. Beyond coffee, they also serve tea, milk, and more. My personal favorite is the White Coffee.

The coffee shop features two distinct spaces. Inside, you can find a quiet area perfect for work, allowing you to stay focused. Outside, you can enjoy the company of friends amidst the refreshing natural air. Both spaces are beautifully designed. While I often choose to sit inside to work, I occasionally opt for the outside area, especially when I'm accompanied by my puppy, Molly.

Ta-coffee is more than just a coffee shop; it's a serene oasis in the heart of Tay Ho. Whether you're seeking a peaceful corner to work or a lively space to chat with friends, this place offers it all. I wholeheartedly recommend visiting Ta-coffee to anyone in Hanoi. It's an experience that blends tranquility, quality, and warmthâ€”a true gem in the city's bustling landscape.

### Izi Coffe

I like to go to Izi coffee in the raining day and of course if Molly goes with me. Because they have inside house where they are allowed my bestfriend Molly join me. 

The owner hear is nice. She also has 2 dogs and she always welcome me and Molly whenever we come here. 

Let me see. I think I have a picture of Molly here. 

Wait a second.... 
Here you go

## Learning new things
And what we do at the coffee Shop?

### As a coder
I usually spend most of the time to learn coding. But sometimes, it's getting hard so I will learn something else. 


### Coursera learning

I'm learning The Project Management Course in Coursera. I want to have a mindset of a manager. Even for now, I know I still have many things need to improve if I want to become a manager, I know the course is still good for me. 


### Book lover 

Beside that, sometimes I want to enjoy the day, relax a little bit. So I'm reading book. 
I'm a book lover!! When I have my own house. I will have a big bookshelf in the living room, where I have all my favorite books there. 
And books will be everywhere. 

You know what? I used to open an online book store. But sadly, I didn't have much experience and knowledge. The documents and the procedure I need to work on is so complicated. My project is failed. 
But I'm glad I gave it a try and of course, one day, hopefully I can reopen it. But next time, I hope I can open an offline store as well. 


## Yoga class, my favorite part 
And then, in the end of the day, I will go to Yoga class close to my home. 
I really enjoy the time I spend there and feel so much stronger, healthier since I join it. 

I need to sit down a lot to work, so it's the time for all my body active. Whenever my boday hurts, I join the class and surprisely, the pain goes away. 

I also think it help my body more flexible and hav a better endurance. Like before, I can never run for a minute. But right now I do so much better. 

Well and an important thing!! I think my body looks better and I love it 


## Hanging out with my friends

Most of my friends are living and working in Hanoi, the same city with me. But we are all busy with work and personal life. Especially at this age, I think everyone is trying to focus on their career. We don't have much time for each other. Maybe once in a few months we will meet up. Hanging out to eat, to get some drinks.
But we still texting and keep update about each other life. 

Even though we don't meet up a lot, but we still keep the relationship closely and always be there when one of the member needs us. 
I'm so lucky to have them as my friends. 

## My day almost finish

So if I'm not going out with my friends. I just stay at home after the Yoga class, working for a few hours then sleep right away once the work is done. 

It's a lonely day you think, right? But it's okay because I have Molly!
