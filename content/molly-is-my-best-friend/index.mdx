I adopted Molly since November 2023, just 3 months but he is already my best friend now. 
He is a son of Vietnamese dad dog and a Yorkshire Terrier mom. He is so small, just 2kgs even he is already 4 months old. 
 
He likes bones, especially chicken bones. Even he is small, he can eat 2 whole chicken wings every day and more if I would give it to him.

He likes to play with balls, small balls. But always lose them because they are so small and he will play with them around the house, lost it in some corners and I can't find it anywhere.

## Molly is my best friend! 

Someone said: 
> A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself.

I don't know how much I love myself, but I think they are right about the dog. Molly love me! He follows me everywhere even around the house. 


I work remotely from home so I spend so many times around him. If I don't work, I will go to the coffee shop to learn something and Molly will follow me there as well. 

## Molly is a sweet boy

He likes to sleep with me on the bed. Funny thing is, sometimes at night, I need to check on him to see if he still breaths, because I am afraid that I slept and crushed him

## We go to the park together a lot! 


There is a small park near my place. And Molly likes to go there to solve his personal need. And he likes to play with other dogs. However, because he is so small, so I'm always afraid the other dogs will bite him. I always need to keep close eye on him.
