## Story 1

The sounds of karaoke echo in the neighborhood, singing 'Em con nho hay em da quen...'

There is a ship and a mountain right behind her. The wind blows through her hair, and smoke drifts around.
Who is leaving? Who is coming? 

Music playing:

“𝐼 𝑎𝑚 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑦 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟, 𝑤ℎ𝑜 ℎ𝑎𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑑 ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡
𝐼'𝑣𝑒 𝑏𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛

## Story 2

Stay! Stay here just a little longer... Let me lay in your arms like this. It's getting hot.

Don't go, please sit there next to me. Should we close the door? The sunshine hurts my eyes

## Story 3

It's noon. It's quiet, only sunshine dancing on the balcony. But why do I feel the heat? My heart is heavy. Oh, I need more sugar for the coffee. It's bitter and salty. Oh, wait. It's tears.
