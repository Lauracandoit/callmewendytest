What do you do during your day? 


## My Day Begins

For me, simplicity reigns supreme. I spend the majority of my time working.

Working from home allows me to commence work early, right from the comfort of my bed. Typically, I rise just 15 minutes before my workday begins, swiftly prepare my tools, and dive straight into work. 

What time do you usually wake up?

Most days, I commence my workday as early as 7 am, sometimes even earlier, at 6 am. However, since I don't have to commute to work, I can afford to wake up just 15 minutes before I start, and that's sufficient.

And just like that, my day begins.

### I skip breakfast

I don't eat breakfast. Not because I don't like it, but because I'm too lazy to wake up early and prepare it.

I know. I know. I know it's not good. But... my bed is too comfy in the morning.

So I skip breakfast and start working right away. I usually work straight for 5-6-7 or even more hours, depending on my schedule for that day. Once the work is done, I will have a nap, maybe just one or two hours.

But I'm quite difficult to sleep, so sometimes I can't sleep and just stay on my phone.

## My favorite coffee
Next, I head to my favorite coffee shop.


### Ta Coffee

On a normal day, when I can take Molly with me and the weather is not too cold, I will go to Ta Coffee. That is one of my favorite coffee spots.

They offer a unique coffee experience, roasting the beans with a large machine right inside the shop. Beyond coffee, they also serve tea, milk, and more. My personal favorite is the White Coffee.

The coffee shop features two distinct spaces. Inside, you can find a quiet area perfect for work, allowing you to stay focused. Outside, you can enjoy the company of friends amidst the refreshing natural air. Both spaces are beautifully designed. While I often choose to sit inside to work, I occasionally opt for the outside area, especially when I'm accompanied by my puppy, Molly.

Ta-coffee is more than just a coffee shop; it's a serene oasis in the heart of Tay Ho. Whether you're seeking a peaceful corner to work or a lively space to chat with friends, this place offers it all. I wholeheartedly recommend visiting Ta-coffee to anyone in Hanoi. It's an experience that blends tranquility, quality, and warmthâ€”a true gem in the city's bustling landscape.

### Izi Coffe

I like to go to Izi coffee on rainy days and of course if Molly goes with me. Because they have an inside area where my best friend Molly can join me.

The owner here is nice. She also has 2 dogs and she always welcomes me and Molly whenever we come here.

Let me see. I think I have a picture of Molly here.

Wait a second....
Here you go

## Learning new things
And what do we do at the coffee shop?

### As a coder
I usually spend most of the time learning coding. But sometimes, it's getting hard so I will learn something else.


### Coursera learning

I'm learning The Project Management Course on Coursera. I want to have the mindset of a manager. Even for now, I know I still have many things to improve if I want to become a manager, I know the course is still good for me.

### Book lover 

Beside that, sometimes I want to enjoy the day, relax a little bit. So I'm reading book. 
I'm a book lover!! When I have my own house. I will have a big bookshelf in the living room, where I have all my favorite books there. 
And books will be everywhere. 

You know what? I used to open an online book store. But sadly, I didn't have much experience and knowledge. The documents and the procedure I need to work on is so complicated. My project is failed. 
But I'm glad I gave it a try and of course, one day, hopefully I can reopen it. But next time, I hope I can open an offline store as well. 



## Yoga class, my favorite part 
And then, in the end of the day, I will go to Yoga class close to my home. 
I really enjoy the time I spend there and feel so much stronger, healthier since I join it. 

I need to sit down a lot to work, so it's the time for all my body active. Whenever my boday hurts, I join the class and surprisely, the pain goes away. 

I also think it help my body more flexible and hav a better endurance. Like before, I can never run for a minute. But right now I do so much better. 

Well and an important thing!! I think my body looks better and I love it 



## Hanging out with my friends

Most of my friends are living and working in Hanoi, the same city with me. But we are all busy with work and personal life. Especially at this age, I think everyone is trying to focus on their career. We don't have much time for each other. Maybe once in a few months we will meet up. Hanging out to eat, to get some drinks.
But we still texting and keep update about each other life. 

Even though we don't meet up a lot, but we still keep the relationship closely and always be there when one of the member needs us. 
I'm so lucky to have them as my friends. 
 

## My day almost finish

So if I'm not going out with my friends. I just stay at home after the Yoga class, working for a few hours then sleep right away once the work is done. 

It's a lonely day you think, right? But it's okay because I have Molly!
