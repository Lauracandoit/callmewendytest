I was borned here, in Hanoi. My hometown is not in the center of Hanoi. Before it called Ha Tay. But now it's Hanoi. 

Even thought I'm not Hanoi original, but I love Hanoi so much.

# Weather in Hanoi.
I love the weather in Hanoi. We have 4 seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. 

Each season, I find it own beauty here.

Spring is the time where Luna New Year Happens. In every streets, people go out to prepare for the biggest Holiday in Vietnam. And Hanoi with it own fresh looks say hi to a new year

Summer started from April until Septenber. This is the hotest time of the year. I can see the sunshine clearly in the air, it's flying. And I don't like hot wearther. Because of sweater every where. There are a lot of motobikes on the street and it awful when it's hot, people will use the horn more and more because everyone is rushing home to avoid the heat. 

I love Autumn in Hanoi. I love driving on the street, where it's not too sunny, not too cold, a lot of wind blow my hairs. In that weather, I enjoy every single moment.

Winter in Hanoi looks a little sad. Sometimes it becomes extremely code: 7-8 Celcius degrees in the morning. It it happens, student in primary school will stay at home. 
I love walking around Westlake in Winter, to feel the wind blow to my face, my hair and to deeply feel the cold. 
When it's cold, eating bbq on the street with my friends is one of the favorite time of me. We talk, we eat. Cold and hot. Everything is just compensate each other
